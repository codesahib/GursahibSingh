	<h1 style="color: #AEFF00;">Actuarial Science</h1>
	<p>In simpler terms, Actuarial Science refers to a field of study where decision making is done based on probability, statistics and risk analysis.</p>
	<p>Seems simple right? But actually it isn't that simple. Being an Actuary requires excellence in Statistics, Economics, Business & Mathematics. Because the nature of Actuarial problems is completely real and logical, that's the reason why it intrigues me to work for it.</p>
	<p>I've cleared 3 Actuarial exams which taught me Statistics(Basic & Advanced), Probability(Basic & Advanced), Statistical Modelling, Insurance Modelling, Risk Analysis etc.</p>
