	<p>I heard somewhere that an engineer must have it's own website and that motivated to build this one. But Web Development is very
	important if you want to take your skill/service to the next level. Your website can reach where you can't.</p>
	<p>If you own a business, have a particular skill or just want to try out on a hands on project, must look for Web Development. </p>
	<p>Building a website is very easy nowadays. Even non-tech people can also do it. But for techies, I would suggest that build a scalable website from scratch and not going for templates available online. This website is also built from scratch using Django. It will give you a control over your product.</p>
