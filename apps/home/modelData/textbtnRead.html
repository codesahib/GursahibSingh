	<h1 style="color: #AEFF00;">Reading</h1>
	<p>Reading opens up the door to the path of finding own self. (Self made quote)</p>
	<p>I started reading Dan Brown novels in school and realized how much interesting the reading process is. It forces your brain to think and imagine the words that are in front of you</p>
	<p>While watching a movie, the correct picturisation of a thought is in front of screen and brain doesn't need to make too much of an effort, but while reading, the brain has to interpret everything on it's own and that's the best form of mental exercise </p>
	<p>I've switched from fictions to self help books including financial help books as well and they present an entire different kind of world
	   Just pick a simple book and develop this habbit. It would be your favourite past time, stress reliever, guide and what not</p>
	<p>If you need a starting point for this journey, ping me up and I'll help you to choose what to read and how to read.</p>
