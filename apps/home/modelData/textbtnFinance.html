	<p>Finance is that one thing that drives everyone crazy at some point of time. Be it being in debt, wanting to own an expensive gadget or a lavish vacation. It creates troubles.</p>
	<p>However, I also realized this trouble and that's why I started reading about how to manage personal finances by streaming your income into a diversified portfolio. This portofolio(or rather better managed finance) would help in the case of emergency
		and would also keep away from bad debts eventually building a financially independent life.</p>
