	<p>Data Science has been around for quite some time now and the reason is obvious, it's necessary! A lot of students prefer to learn Machine learning & Data Science nowadays because the trends show that it's one of the highest paying jobs. Thats' a good reason to learn the subject. But could there be anything more into this?</p>
	<p>Well, when I started learning Data Science, I honestly didn't know about the job prospects. It was a buzz word and just wanted to know more about it. But frankly speaking it does justice to all the buzz that's there around this subject </p>
