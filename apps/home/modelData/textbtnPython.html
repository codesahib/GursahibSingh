	<p>Well tech enthusiasts would know the magical world of Python. For others, Python is a programming language which can help build wide range of applications.</p>
	<p>I started learning programming from C++ but I was introduced to Python when learning Machine Learning. And since then, I've used python as my primary language. I've used it in Machine Learning project, during my internship with work relating to Web Development and also automate certain daily tasks on my PC</p>
	<p>The best part about python is the wide range of libraries it offers which can solve different range of problems quite easily and effectively. I'm still consider myself a beginner as there is still too much to learn and implement</p>
