	<p>It's important to realize that health is above all. And because of this realization, I'm able to continue on my fitness journey without any external motivation.
	   Some of form of physical activity is required to stay human. Be it Weight Training, Aerobics, Cardio, Calisthenic, Yoga etc.</p>
	<p> Physical Fitness has helped alot in getting the right mindset and achieve the utmost required discipline. One thing that is guaranteed is discipline and I think that is the biggest motivator of all.
	</p>
	<p>In any case you want to start your fitness journey and get some lead based on your goal, feel free to ping me up on given platforms.</p>
